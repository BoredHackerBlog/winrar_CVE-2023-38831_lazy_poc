lazy way to create CVE-2023-38831 winrar file for testing

Article that mentioned this vuln and the sample: https://www.group-ib.com/blog/cve-2023-38831-winrar-zero-day/

I took a malicious winrar file (049af32f678da5e344315ce46787e8fc https://gist.github.com/BoredHackerBlog/83cd5ca743189bf72b28ebaabe3c3df0) and removed all the included files besides the folder and main readme file

I created a new file with my command and added it to the ReadMe.txt folder and renamed the file to 'ReadMe.txt .cmd.'

'ReadMe.txt .cmd' works too, so does .bat, feel free to experiment
